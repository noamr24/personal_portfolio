                I am a 27-year-old computer science student at Reichman University, currently in my second year, and working as a Software Applications Engineer at Vayyar. I have always been passionate about technology and programming, and I am excited to be pursuing this field of study and profession.<br><br>
                  I come from a family of Udi and Michal, and I have two sisters, Omer and Anat. I am engaged to Amelie, who I met during my travels, and we are planning to get married in September in France. I am grateful to have her in my life and excited to start this new chapter with her.<br><br>
                  Before pursuing my studies and career in tech, I served as a combat-drone operator and commander for the Rochev Shamaim unit during my military service. It was a challenging and rewarding experience that taught me the importance of teamwork, leadership, and responsibility. After completing my service, I decided to take some time to travel the world and see new cultures. I traveled to India, Mongolia, Thailand, Australia, Tenerife, and France. These experiences have been invaluable and have broadened my perspective on life.<br><br>
                  In my free time, I enjoy playing chess, watching all kinds of sports, especially football and Manchester United, solving puzzles and riddles and traveling. I find these activities to be a great way to relax and unwind after a long day of studying or working.
